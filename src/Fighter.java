 * Description: The Fighter class is a subclass of the PlayerEntity class. 
 *              The Fighter class has same attributes as the parent class(playerEntity), but also has the following attributes: armor, maxAttack, and isRanged.
 *              Within the it used the abstract method computeCombatPower() to compute the combat points of the fighter.
 *              and also has a toString() method that returns a string representation of the object.
